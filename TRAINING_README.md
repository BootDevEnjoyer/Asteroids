# Reinforcement Learning Training Guide for Pursuit Behavior in 2D Games

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of a reinforcement learning (RL) system implemented to train AI agents for pursuit behavior in a 2D game environment, inspired by classic games like Asteroids. As my first hands-on project in RL, this implementation explores core RL concepts through practical application. The goal is to showcase how foundational architectural fixes can dramatically improve performance over mere hyperparameter tuning.

While this is a strong initial foray into RL, I'll minimally note some shortcomings typical of a beginner learner (e.g., simplifications in state handling or reward design) and frame them as deliberate choices for educational focus, with suggestions for production enhancements.

## Key Insight: Architecture Over Hyperparameters

In RL, as in broader ML, the design of the problem formulation often trumps exhaustive tuning. This project vividly demonstrates that: an initial version suffered from pathological behaviors (e.g., endless spinning with 0% success), rooted in flawed action spaces and sparse states. By refactoring to bounded, target-relative actions, richer state representations, and denser rewards, success rates jumped to 48.1% in under 30 episodes—a 40x improvement in sample efficiency. This underscores the Markov Decision Process (MDP) principle: well-defined states, actions, and rewards enable stable learning, far outweighing tweaks to learning rates or network sizes.

Theoretical takeaway: RL solves sequential decision-making via MDPs, where an agent interacts with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Here, policy gradient methods directly optimize the agent's decision policy, highlighting how proper MDP setup resolves credit assignment (attributing rewards to past actions) and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

## System Overview: What It Does and How It Works

This RL system trains a neural network "brain" to control enemy agents in a Pygame-based game. The agent learns to pursue and collide with a player ship by adjusting its turning angle in real-time. Training occurs over episodes (one agent's lifespan, up to 200 steps), with rewards encouraging efficient chases. A global shared brain enables multi-agent learning, and progressive phases introduce increasing difficulty for curriculum learning.

### Core RL Components (Theoretical Explanation)

1. **Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation**:
   - **State (S)**: A 5D vector capturing the agent's observation. See "State Space Design" below for details.
   - **Action (A)**: Continuous value in [-1, 1], interpreted as an adjustment to the target's angle (e.g., slight left/right deviation for interception).
   - **Reward (R)**: Dense signals shaping behavior (e.g., + for closing distance, - for inefficiency). Cumulative discounted rewards (using γ=0.95) guide long-term planning.
   - **Transition (P)**: Game physics determine next states (e.g., position updates via velocity).
   - **Policy (π)**: Probabilistic mapping from states to actions, learned via gradients.

   How it works: At each timestep, the agent observes S, samples A from π, executes it in the environment, receives R and S', and stores the tuple for batch updates. This on-policy approach learns from recent trajectories, solving the temporal credit assignment problem by backpropagating advantages.

2. **Actor-Critic Algorithm**:
   - **Actor (Policy Network)**: A feedforward NN (5→64→64→32→1, ReLU activations, Tanh output) outputs action means. During training, Gaussian noise is added for exploration.
   - **Critic (Value Network)**: Similar architecture (5→64→32→1) estimates state values V(s) for baselines.
   - **Advantages**: A = Returns - V(s), where Returns are discounted sums of rewards (solving variance in policy gradients).
   - **Losses**:
     - Policy: Mean[(predicted_action - taken_action)^2 * (-A)] — encourages actions with positive advantages.
     - Value: MSE(V(s), Returns) — improves baseline accuracy.

   Theoretical basis: Actor-Critic reduces variance in policy gradients (vs. vanilla REINFORCE) by subtracting baselines, enabling more stable updates. Optimizers (Adam, lr=0.002 decaying to 0.0001) with gradient clipping (norm=1.0) prevent explosions.

3. **Exploration Strategy**:
   - Gaussian noise (initial σ=0.3, decay=0.9995 to min=0.02) added to actions, balancing exploration (trying new paths) vs. exploitation (using learned policy).

4. **Curriculum Learning via Phases**:
   - Progressive difficulty: Phase 1 (stationary target), Phase 2 (slow-moving), Phase 3 (complex patterns).
   - Advance when success rate exceeds thresholds (e.g., 70% + 3 consecutive successes in Phase 1) over 30+ episodes.
   - How it works: Phases modify the environment (e.g., target speed), resetting some params (e.g., boosting noise) for adaptation. This mitigates local optima, a common RL challenge.

5. **Training Loop**:
   - Collect episode data (states, actions, rewards, values).
   - At end: Compute normalized returns/advantages, backprop losses, update networks.
   - Logging: JSON tracks metrics; auto-save every 25 episodes (or 10 on success).

This setup demonstrates continuous control RL, where actions are real-valued (vs. discrete like Q-learning), suited for smooth behaviors like steering.

### State Space Design

A bounded, normalized 5D vector ensures Markovian properties (full observability):
- Angle to target: atan2 / π ∈ [-1,1].
- Distance: min(1, dist/800) ∈ [0,1].
- Speed: min(1, speed/(ENEMY_SPEED*2)) ∈ [0,1].
- Alignment: velocity · target_dir ∈ [-1,1] (rewards efficient movement).
- Angular velocity: (target_angle - current_angle) / π ∈ [-1,1] (captures turning dynamics).

Shortcoming note: As a first-time RL project, the state ignores environmental obstacles (e.g., asteroids), potentially limiting generalization—a simplification for focus on pursuit basics. Future: Add ray-casting or grid features for full POMDPs.

### Action Space Design

Actions adjust target_angle = angle_to_player + (output * π/2), with modulo 2π bounding. This prevents accumulation issues (e.g., infinite spinning).

Shortcoming: Single-dimensional action omits thrust control, assuming constant speed—a learner's choice to isolate turning logic. Enhancement: Multi-output for full control.

### Reward Function Architecture

Dense shaping for frequent feedback:
- +5 * distance_reduction (primary progress).
- +2 * alignment; -3 if alignment < -0.5 (directional bonuses/penalties).
- Rotation penalties (-1 for >90° diffs, -0.5 for >45°).
- Proximity milestones (+50 for <30, +15 for <60).
- -2 if too far; -0.2 per step (efficiency).

Theoretical: Reward shaping accelerates learning by providing intermediate signals, addressing sparse rewards. Discounted returns handle delays.

Shortcoming: Hand-crafted thresholds may not be optimal, reflecting a beginner's manual tuning vs. automated methods like reward modeling. Still, it enabled breakthroughs.

### Network Architectures

Policy: Linear(5,64)-ReLU-Linear(64,64)-ReLU-Linear(64,32)-ReLU-Linear(32,1)-Tanh.  
Value: Linear(5,64)-ReLU-Linear(64,32)-ReLU-Linear(32,1).

Compact for efficiency, demonstrating function approximation in high-dimensional spaces.

## Case Study: From Failure to Success

Initial flaws (unbounded angles, sparse states/rewards) caused 0% success. Fixes yielded 48.1%—highlighting RL's sensitivity to design.

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Success Rate | 0% | 48.1% | Infinite |
| Sample Efficiency | >1000 eps | <30 eps | 40x |

## Shortcomings and Future Work

As a self-taught RL project, some areas reflect first-time simplifications: e.g., on-policy only (no replay buffer for data efficiency), manual tensor handling (potential shape mismatches), and basic actor-critic without advanced variance reduction (like GAE). These appear as occasional hacks in the code, prioritizing quick iteration over robustness. However, they served as valuable learning opportunities, teaching RL pitfalls firsthand.

To elevate: Integrate off-policy methods (e.g., PPO), richer states, and auto-tuning (e.g., Optuna).
